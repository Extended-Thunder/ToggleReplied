ToggleReplied Thunderbird
=========================

Add-on for Thunderbird which allows the replied and forwarded flags on existing
messages.

This version of this add-on is maintained by Jonathan Kamens with the support
of Extended Thunder Inc. Email questions and feedback to
[jik@extended-thunder.org][email]. You may also email bug reports there, or
[post them on Github][issues].

Thank you to Christian Eyrich, the original author of this add-on. This version
has been almost entirely rewritten to support new Thunderbird versions, but his original add-on served as inspiration and pointed us in the right direction for how to leverage Thunderbird's innards to make this possible.
